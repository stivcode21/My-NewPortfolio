  "parkify": {
    "description": "Parkify is a responsive web application for parking lot management. It started as a Figma design and evolved into a fullstack functional app using Supabase, without the need for a custom backend. It features user authentication, access control, CRUD operations for vehicles, history tracking, lockers management, and more.",
    "shortDescription": "Web app for managing parking lots with authentication and complete user control.",
    "objective": "The goal of Parkify was to build a complete digital solution that allows intuitive and secure management of parking lots directly from the browser. The aim was to develop a platform that includes vehicle registration, activity history, locker management, user control, and proper validation while learning modern technologies throughout the process.",
    "development": "I initially started the project using Astro, but migrated to React due to the need for a more dynamic interface. For the backend, I used Supabase, which enabled me to implement authentication via magic link, session management, secure database queries, and SQL-based row-level security policies. I used React Router to protect routes based on the user's state (authenticated, new profile creation, etc.). I also implemented toast notifications to inform users about the outcome of their actions and built a complete parking management system with features like vehicle check-in, check-out, history logs, and locker tracking.",
    "conclusion": "Parkify was my first experience creating a fully functional fullstack app. It helped me learn about databases, modern authentication methods, and route control in React. Although it is still in beta, it is fully operational, and I plan to continue improving it. I'm proud of the learning process and of having turned a simple design into a real, useful, and scalable application."
